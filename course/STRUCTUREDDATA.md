## What Is This

![structured data what is this title](../assets/img/structured-data-title-what.jpg)

1. **Infos** that crawlers are looking for, and can easily read
2. **Consistent structure**
3. **Formatted on ld-json** in a special script tag

![ld-json format script pic example](../assets/img/script-ld-json-img.jpg)

Make your search results much more rich!

> This is a way to ensure that every infos related to the website or the business is correct:
>- name of the organization/who owns the company
>- what twitter/fb accounts are associated with, the phone number
>...

Usually added to the body html tag, there are various techniques to handle this task
We are using **"Breadcrumbs"** here, the **ld+json format** (putted on **a script tag**).

This is our job to assume what to do with that task
And schema.org will help on it, specifying how to do on each task we want to add

## What Does This Get Us

1. **Enhance features** in apps

2. **Indexers don't have to guess so much** about connections 
between things

3. More controls over the **search results look**

The Main Advantage we got, is to confirm and make sure the information are correct **getting more control in the way you look** with this data structure.

- correct brand/name spelling
- rating and vote
- date & infos  about events...
- ingredients for a recipe

This is just Breadcrumbs, but its a lot of infos. It could easily be a BIG json files with a lots of infos there, depending of what we need, of what we want to do with that file...

 #### Schema org: the documentation

[*Schema org website*](https://schema.org/)

![schema intro pic](../assets/img/schema-org-title.jpg)

Schema.org provides a huge list of schemas. They provide like a standard shape for, with the name of the properties and the types expected in the values (sub-types too).

We have to find out what categories, then putting a value (type), implementing our json file. 
Usually it seems to have the same categories used, it needs more info on that topic, getting more precision in our work.
