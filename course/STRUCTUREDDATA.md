## What Is This

![structured data what is this title](../assets/img/structured-data-title-what.jpg)

This is a way to ensure that everything is correct.

> i.e
>- name of the organization / who owns the company
>- what twitter/fb accounts are associated with, the phone number
>...

Usually added to the body html tag, there are various techniques to handle this task
We are using here the **ld+json format** putted on **a script tag**.

This is our job to assume what to do with that task
And schema.org will help on it, specifying how to do on each task we want to add

> NOTICE :
> it will be show up only on mobile device
> the trend is to optimize the mobile experience user

1. **Infos** that crawlers are looking for, and can easily read
2. **Consistent structure**
3. **Formatted on ld-json** in a special script tag

The Main Advantage we got, is to confirm and make sure the information are correct getting more control in the way you look with this data structure.

- correct brand/name spelling
- rating and vote
- date & infos  about events...
- ingredients for a recipe
- pagination or path...


1. **Enhance features** in apps
2. **Indexers don't have to guess so mush** about connections between things
3. More controls over the **search results look**
